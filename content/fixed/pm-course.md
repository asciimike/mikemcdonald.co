When I joined Firebase a month after graduation, I had zero experience
with product management. My degree and all my studies were focused exlusively
on technical subjects, and I lacked a lot of the business acumen and many of
the social skills required to PM effectively.

So, just prior to [leaving Google](/blog/2019/08/07/why-i-left-google), I sent an
email to the head of the CSSE department at [Rose-Hulman](https://rose-hulman.edu)
asking if they'd be interested in having me come teach a once-per-week course
on product management as an elective for upper division students. Luckily,
they were excited to have me, and I slotted in a class for Fall 2019.

My goals for the course are:

 * give students all the skills they need in order to get a PM internship or full-time role
 * inspire students to start their own companies
 * create a pipeline of good PM hires
 * refresh my own PM skills in perparation for what's next

While it's hard to fit everything into 30 hours of lecture, here's my first attempt:

 * [The what, why, and who of PM; what makes a good product](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fCQRTQA4qupEA2uRf5cLK-vPIzyMPBvJODvgFPSpePI/edit?usp=sharing)
 * [TAM, MVP, and product/market fit](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HP7_beiJ66ABJTr4BMsM0fawHiX9XNtecPML_V0aT4Y/edit?usp=sharing)
 * [Business models and competitive analysis](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19XXKTibLyNNZdK1TsC3offY67-pTPwMDBp6FLaKCue8/edit?usp=sharing)
 * Roadmaps, strategy, and stakeholders
 * Design and user research
 * Metrics and growth
 * Making and spending money
 * Legal risk, contracts, and compliance
 * Working with engineering and ops
 * [Getting a job as a PM and daily life in the role](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1b1qR6PgBz-OKfTymXx98L1-b8JohKudlYRvshMLDb-w/edit?usp=sharing)
