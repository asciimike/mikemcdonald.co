I've spent a lot of the past several years traveling around the US, Europe, and
Asia (mostly for business, occasionally for pleasure). I've had the pleasure of
eating a lot of great food, drinking  delicious cocktails with friends (old and
new), and finding hidden speakeasies in foreign countries.

I've mentioned many of these locations to friends, but wanted to finally list my
favorite places in each city as a mini-reference to those interested in the same
things I like.

Each city will include a Google Maps map with these locations saved so you can
copy it to your saved places.

Without further ado:

 * [Amsterdam](/cities/amsterdam)
 * [Bangkok](/cities/bangkok)
 * [Copenhagen](/cities/copenhagen)
 * [Denver](/cities/denver)
 * [Hong Kong](/cities/hong-kong)
 * [London](/cities/london)
 * [Manila](/cities/manila)
 * [New York](/cities/new-york)
 * [Oslo](/cities/oslo)
 * [San Francisco](/cities/san-francisco)
 * [Seattle](/cities/seattle)
 * [Stockholm](/cities/stockholm)
 * [Tel Aviv](/cities/tel-aviv)
 * [Tokyo](/cities/tokyo)
 * [Vancouver](/cities/vancouver)
