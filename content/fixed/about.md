Hey, I'm Mike! Nice to meet you, and thanks for stopping by :)

I'm a product manager at [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), an iOS
developer, and a part-time hardware hacker. I spend my time making mobile
development easier, connecting my appliances to the internet, and talking
to developers about why those are useful (and fun!) things to do.

Formerly, I worked at [The Omni Group](https://www.omnigroup.com/)
building iOS apps, [Texas Instruments](http://www.ti.com/) working on embedded
microcontrollers (specifically the MSP430), and a few other places, mostly
doing embedded software/hardware.

Outside of that:

- I'm a passionate chef who loves nice whisk(e)y
- I travel as often as I can
- I get outdoors to hike, bike, snowboard, or scuba dive

If you find yourself in the Bay Area, reach out and let's grab üçµ!
