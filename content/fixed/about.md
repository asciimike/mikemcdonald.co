Hey, I'm Mike!

I was the first product manager at [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/),
and a long time PM on [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/),
specifically on serverless compute ([App Engine](http://cloud.google.com/appengine),
[Cloud Functions](http://cloud.google.com/functions), and
[Cloud Run](http://cloud.google.com/run)).
[I left Google in July 2019](/blog/2019/08/07/why-i-left-google), and am
currently taking some time off to work on personal projects and detox from
the corporate lifestyle. I'm also teaching a
[course on product management](/pm-course) at [Rose-Hulman](https://rose-hulman.edu).

Before Firebase, I worked at [The Omni Group](https://www.omnigroup.com/)
building iOS apps, [Texas Instruments](http://www.ti.com/) working on embedded
microcontrollers (specifically the MSP430), and a few other places, mostly
doing embedded software/hardware.

Outside of work:

- I'm a lover of interesting whisky, rum, and cognac
- I [travel](/travel) as often as I can
- I get outdoors to hike, bike, snowboard, or scuba dive

If you find yourself in the Bay Area, reach out and let's grab a warm
or cool beverage!
