It's been an uncomfortably long time since I wrote a post, partly because work
has been busy and party because I've been travling so much. Since my last post
I've been to: Japan, Korea, Thailand, Hong Kong, Canada, the Dominican Republic,
India, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Poland, Israel, and New
Zealand. The rest of 2018 will add Indonesia, Malaysia, the UK, the Czech
Republic, Greece, and (hopefully) Taiwan.

While I don't always have time to get out and see the sights, I have been lucky
enough to find some really amazing spots when I have gone out. My friends know
how annoying I am about providing suggestions when they travel, but the more
annoying problem was transfering that knowledge once I told them about
*the best* little whisky bar in Bangkok.

To make it easier to share this knowledge, I'm posting information about my
favorite places around the world! Maps are up for all cities, but only
[Tokyo](/cities/tokyo) has copy describing why they're my favorite and how to
get there. Given the fullness of time (and a less hectic travel schedule), I'll
add descriptions to each city.

Note that there are lots of great things to do in these cities! These are *my*
favorite things, so they may not align with guidebooks or other peoples blogs.
But I promise, if you're me, you'll love them ;)
